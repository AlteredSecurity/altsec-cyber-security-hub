    - title: RET2 WarGames Browser-Based Training Platform
      short-description: An interactive, browser-based InfoSec training platform modeling real-world tools and workflows.
      description: |
       RET2 WarGames provides a comprehensive, browser-based training platform for InfoSec education. It eliminates the need for setup or specialized software, 
       fitting entirely within a single browser tab. The platform faithfully simulates industry-standard tools, focusing on low-level system research including 
       C-based vulnerabilities and writing successful exploits. Lab challenges offer real-time feedback and powerful introspection collects detailed analytics. 
       Learning is paced and broken down into manageable chunks, with gamified checkpoints to encourage active learning.
